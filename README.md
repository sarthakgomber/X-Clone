**X (Twitter) UI Clone – Built with Tailwind CSS**

This project is a static frontend clone of the UI of X (formerly Twitter), created using only Tailwind CSS. It was developed to practice modern UI design and utility-first CSS techniques.

**Features:**

* Sidebar with navigation icons (Home, Explore, Messages, etc.)
* Center feed with "For You" and "Following" tabs
* Input box for "What’s Happening"
* Sample static posts with images and interaction icons
* Right panel with trending topics and suggested follows

**Technologies Used:**

* HTML
* Tailwind CSS (v4)
* Google Fonts (Material Symbols for icons)

**How to Run:**

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser.
3. Make sure the `output.css` file (generated by Tailwind) is correctly linked in the project.

**Purpose:**
This project was built as a UI development exercise to improve my skills in:

* Responsive layout using Tailwind
* Clean design with utility classes
* Structuring complex UI pages with minimal custom CSS

**Note:**
This clone is static and not connected to any backend or API. No JavaScript functionality is included.

**Credits:**
All content and icons are used for educational purposes only. Inspired by the UI of X (Twitter).
